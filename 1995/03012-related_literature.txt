DOI: 10.3386/w23939
Abstract: http://www.nber.org/papers/w23939
Observing rapid structural transformation accompanied by a continual
process of rural to urban migration in many developing countries, we
construct a micro founded dynamic framework to explore how important
education-based migration is, as opposed to work-based migration, for
economic development, urbanization and city workforce composition. We then
calibrate our model to fit the data from China over the period from 1980 to
2007, a developing economy featuring not only large migration flows but
major institutional reforms that may affect work and education based
migration differently. We find that, although education-based migration
only amounts to one-fifth of that of work-based migration, its contribution
to the enhancement of per capita output is larger than that of work-based
migration. Moreover, the abolishment of the government job assignment for
college graduates and the relaxation of the work-based migration have
limited effects on economic development and urbanization. Furthermore, the
increase in college admission selectivity for rural students plays a
crucial but negative role in China's development, lowering per capita
output and worsening the high-skilled employment share in urban areas.
