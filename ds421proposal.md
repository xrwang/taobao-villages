## Proposal for DS421

- Project: taobao-villages, CHIP dataset cleaning + analysis
- Name: Xiaowei Wang, @xrwang
- Dataset lives here: http://ciid.bnu.edu.cn/chip/index.asp as well as some available without registration here: https://www.icpsr.umich.edu/icpsrweb/ICPSR/series/243
- 3 questions / analysis tasks you will perform on the data; in the spirit of the assignments we have been doing:
  1. How has income distribution in China shifted over the past 10 years?
  2. What rural income look like geographically -- is southern China richer than the north?
  3. Are there pervasive variables that influence household income levels in rural China?
  4. Have Alibaba sponsored Taobao villages caused unexpected income growth in rural counties?


`Rubric`
  Requirements: Complete projects have at least three questions used to illustrate all of the following tasks:

      Some form of data access / reading into R +
      Data tidying preparation +
      Initial data visualization ~~
      Use of GitHub +
      Reproducible execution with use of Travis +
      RMarkdown writeup, with final submission as a nicely formatted PDF document that includes code and results. +
      Overall clean and clear presentation of repository, code, and explanations. +

  AND at least three of the following skills (this list may be modified/extended):

      Use of at least 5 `dplyr` verbs / functions +
      Writing / working with custom R functions
      Creating an R package for functions used in the analysis
      Interaction with an API - Use of regular expressions ~+
      Use of an external relational database
      Preparing processed data for archiving / publication
      Parsing extensible data formats (JSON, XML)
      Use of spatial vector data (`sf` package) and visualization of spatial data ~+
      Creation of an R package
      Use of `purrr` package functions for iteration
      Manipulation of dates or strings
      Unique challenges you encounter: particularly messy data/ non-standard formats, special emphasis on visualization or presentation of results.
