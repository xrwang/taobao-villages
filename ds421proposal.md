## Proposal for DS421

- Project: taobao-villages, CHIP dataset cleaning + analysis
- Name: Xiaowei Wang, @xrwang
- Dataset lives here: http://ciid.bnu.edu.cn/chip/index.asp as well as some available without registration here: https://www.icpsr.umich.edu/icpsrweb/ICPSR/series/243
- 3 questions / analysis tasks you will perform on the data; in the spirit of the assignments we have been doing:
  1. How has income distribution in China shifted over the past 10 years?
  2. What rural income look like geographically -- is southern China richer than the north?
  3. Are there pervasive variables that influence household income levels in rural China?
  4. Have Alibaba sponsored Taobao villages caused unexpected income growth in rural counties?
