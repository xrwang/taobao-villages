#Contents

This is a final project PDF document for DS421 stitched together from other experiments in this rpo. 

Some major goals were:
- Get satellite data/imagery for village and county names.
- Poke around household income data
- Poke around land use change for a few Taobao villages. 

## Section A
First we'll take a look at household income data from CHIP, an{rd geocode the counties based off a csv of "official administrative codes".

We'll also poke at the data a bit, looking at changes over time.

## Section B


##CHIP

CHIP (China Household Income Project) is put out by the CIID Beijing as a longitudinal survey. It's been happening since 1988 and includes all kinds of juicy stuff including land use.

Load up necessary libraries. Some data is in `.dta` which is Stata file. 

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE, message = FALSE)
