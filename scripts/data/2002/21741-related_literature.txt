The Great Famine in China (1959-1961) is one of the most dramatic tragedies
in history, which may have long term consequences for economic behaviors of
Chinese population. In particular, we explore whether it continues to have
impacts on household saving choices. Employing a dataset across 122 Chinese
counties, we find that the saving rate of rural households in 2002 tend to
be higher in counties where the famine was severer; and the impact of the
famine is even larger, once its severity is instrumented. Evidence from
individual preference data shows that people are more willing to cultivate
thrift in children in counties more severely affected. These findings are
consistent with the hypothesis that the Great Famine altered the thrifty
attitude of survivors and subsequent generations.

Despite its enormous success in GDP growth, last three decades witnessed an
increasing level of income inequality in China. However, previous studies
observed a positive effect of general income inequality (as measured by
county/city-level Gini coefficients) on subjective well-being in both rural
and urban China. How doesit come?
And does the positive effect of inequality still exist later?
This study uses two cross-sectional datasets from a national survey
program, and finds that compared with 2002, general income inequality turns
to have a negative impact on the subjective well-being of urban Chinese in
2007, which is robust to alternative model and other inequality measures.
This contrast indicates that urban Chinese have lowered their tolerance for
income inequality during the 2000s, and suggests that the “tunnel effect”
is no longer prevalent. By analyzing happiness indicator, this study
provides
evidence of the changing attitudes to inequality in the post-reform China.
Whether a nation’s subjective well-being is positively affected by
inequality is highly related with the fact that whether an economy can
still provide hope of getting better off for all.

DOI: 10.3386/w23939
Abstract: http://www.nber.org/papers/w23939
Observing rapid structural transformation accompanied by a continual
process of rural to urban migration in many developing countries, we
construct a micro founded dynamic framework to explore how important
education-based migration is, as opposed to work-based migration, for
economic development, urbanization and city workforce composition. We then
calibrate our model to fit the data from China over the period from 1980 to
2007, a developing economy featuring not only large migration flows but
major institutional reforms that may affect work and education based
migration differently. We find that, although education-based migration
only amounts to one-fifth of that of work-based migration, its contribution
to the enhancement of per capita output is larger than that of work-based
migration. Moreover, the abolishment of the government job assignment for
college graduates and the relaxation of the work-based migration have
limited effects on economic development and urbanization. Furthermore, the
increase in college admission selectivity for rural students plays a
crucial but negative role in China's development, lowering per capita
output and worsening the high-skilled employment share in urban areas.

." UNU-MERIT Working Paper Series #2016-069. Maastricht, The Netherlands:
United Nations University; Maastricht Economic and Social Research
Institute on Innovation and Technology , 2016.
The paper studies the levels and changes in wage inequality among Chinese
ruralurban migrants during 2002-2007. Using data from two waves of national
household surveys, we find that wage inequality among migrants decreased
significantly between 2002 and 2007. Our analysis on the wage distribution
further shows that the high-wage migrants experienced slower wage growth
than middle-and low-wage migrants – a primary cause of declining inequality
of migrants. By using distributional decomposition methods based on
quantile regression, we find that the overall between-group effect
dominates in the whole wage distribution, which means that the change in
returns to the characteristics (education, experience and other employment
characteristics) plays a key role, but on the upper tails of the wage
distribution, the within-group effect (residual effect) dominates, implying
that the unobservable factors or institutional barriers do not
favour the migrants at the top tail of the wage distribution. We also study
wage differential between migrants and urban natives, and find that though
the wage gap is narrowed, the gap at the upper wage distribution is
becoming bigger. Overall, the results suggest that there exists a strong
“glass ceiling” for migrants in the urban labour market.

We use unique data characterizing individual savings for twins and non-
twins in urban China to examine why the savings rates of the young are
elevated relative to the middle-aged, despite rising individual life-cycle
incomes. We show that inter-generational co-residence masks the true life-
cycle patterns of individual savings in standard Chinese household data
sets, which are aggregated at the household level. Moreover, we show that
to understand life-cycle savings behavior it is necessary to take into
account inter-generational co-residence, an important phenomenon in China
and in many developing countries. To test a model that describes joint
life-cycle savings and co-residence decisions by two generations, we use a
variety of standard twins methods. The estimates provide support for the
model, including that individuals born into larger families provide less
financial support to parents and are more likely to co-reside with parents
when young, but do not have different savings rates. We also found that
inter-generational co-residence is lower the higher the incomes of the
young but higher when the parents have higher incomes and that inter-
generational co-residence, net of income, is associated with higher savings
for the young but not higher savings for the old. Our results highlight the
importance of high housing costs and the prevalence of inter-generational
shared housing as key reasons for the higher savings rates for the urban
young in China, but also indicate that in urban China neither old-age
support by the young nor the one-child policy are major factors.

Job-related welfare entitlements are common in China. Migrants who do not
hold urban registration are, in principle, not entitled to job-related
welfare even if they are employees in the State sector. The official
explanation is that rural-urban migrants are allocated access to farm land
in their rural origins, and hence their welfare rights and security are
covered by this entitlement to the use of land. In this paper, we look at
whether migrants still benefited from these opportunities. Second, we
investigate whether it is the poor, the unentitled and the vulnerable that
are excluded from public protection programs. Chinese official social
protection programs are, like in most western countries, officially
designated as being for poverty alleviation. However would such programs
still be targeted in ways that limit their coverage, curtail the range of
basic needs provided for and allocate benefits very unequally? Thirdly, we
explore whether households with favourable productive characteristics are
more likely to get into social protection programs. Here, the ongoing
debate concerning equality of opportunity and equality of outcomes has some
relevance. Finally, we examine the roles social networks or Guanxi (the
Chinese term for social connections) may play in dealing with economic
shocks.

Abstract: http://ssrn.com/abstract=2543406
I study the long-term impact of class identity (chengfen) on individuals’
income and households’ wealth in urban China using Chinese Household Income
Project (CHIP) data. Chinese government launched movements to make income
and consumption in cities substantially homogeneous and assigned an
inheritable class identity to each family in the 1950s. The government then
implemented class-based discriminatory policies against the rich and middle
class until 1978. I show that the policy is effective in reducing the
political and educational opportunities of people with rich or middle class
background, however, it does not break the law of intergenerational
transmission of wealth status: individuals with poor class origins still
have significantly lower income and family assets per capita than those
from the rich class. The only exception is for those individuals with
revolutionary background and Chinese Community Party (CCP) members from the
poor class. Their income is not significantly different from those with
rich class background.

Abstract: http://ssrn.com/abstract=2543406
I study the long-term impact of class identity (chengfen) on individuals’
income and households’ wealth in urban China using Chinese Household Income
Project (CHIP) data. Chinese government launched movements to make income
and consumption in cities substantially homogeneous and assigned an
inheritable class identity to each family in the 1950s. The government then
implemented class-based discriminatory policies against the rich and middle
class until 1978. I show that the policy is effective in reducing the
political and educational opportunities of people with rich or middle class
background, however, it does not break the law of intergenerational
transmission of wealth status: individuals with poor class origins still
have significantly lower income and family assets per capita than those
from the rich class. The only exception is for those individuals with
revolutionary background and Chinese Community Party (CCP) members from the
poor class. Their income is not significantly different from those with
rich class background.

China experiences an increasingly severe relative surplus of men in the
pre-marital age cohort. The
existing literature on its consequences focuses mostly on negative aspects
such as crime. In this paper,
we provide evidence that the imbalance may also stimulate economic growth
by inducing more
entrepreneurship and hard work. First, new domestic private firms – an
important engine of growth
– are more likely to emerge from regions with a higher sex ratio imbalance.
Second, the likelihood
for parents with a son to be entrepreneurs rises with the local sex ratio.
Third, households with a son
in regions with a more skewed sex ratio demonstrate a greater willingness
to accept relatively dangerous
or unpleasant jobs and supply more work days. In contrast, the labor supply
pattern by households
with a daughter is unrelated to the sex ratio. Finally, regional GDP tends
to grow faster in provinces
with a higher sex ratio. Since the sex ratio imbalance will become worse in
the near future, this growth
effect is likely to persist.

This paper explores industrial segregation and its impact on the wage gaps
between rural-to-urban migrants and local urban residents in China. Using
the Chinese Household Income Project (CHIP) 2002 and 2013 surveys, we
analyzed the probabilities of entry to various industries for both migrant
and local urban resident groups; using the model of Brown et al. (1980), we
then undertook a decomposition analysis of the wage gaps. Several major
conclusions emerge. First, although inter-industry differentials and intra-
industry differentials both affect the wage gap between migrants and local
urban residents, the effect of intra-industrial differentials is greater in
both 2002 and 2013. Second, in considering the effect of intra-industry
differentials, while the influence of explained differentials is greater
than that of unexplained differentials in both 2002 and 2013, the influence
of the unexplained component of the intra-industrial differentials rises
steeply from 19.4% (2002) to 68.0% (2013). The results show that when other
factors are held constant, the problem of discrimination against migrants
in a given industry is becoming more serious. In addition, the influence of
the explained component of the intra-industry differentials rises from
61.2% (2002) to 77.7% (2013).
